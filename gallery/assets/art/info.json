    "date": [2023, 3, 13],
    "info": "One of the first pieces I tried back-lighting on, but my main focus while drawing this was the background, not the character. I really liked the scenery, but I didn't know how to draw clothing at the time."

    "name": "Dragon",
    "date": [2023, 3, 21],

    "name": "Sailor",
    "date": [2023, 4, 1],
    "info": "This was the first artwork after my studies. I can say, it looks much different, and better, than the previous piece. First time I finally realized core shadow was important. I also switched over to a blockier look."

    "name": "Machine",
    "date": [2023, 4, 14],
    "info": "I always wanted to do something mechanical instead of fantastical. Here was my attempt at that. I still didn't know how to draw metal, so nothing looks shiny â€“ just plain rough steel. But the lighting was nice."

    "name": "Dragon",
    "date": [2023, 4, 28],
    "info": "This piece took way too long to complete, with me working on it daily. This was where I encountered the problem of layers. I was using so many to the point I had to duplicate the piece, and collapse some layers in one of the copies to prevent permanently deleting layers. This was also when I actually studied how to draw metal."

    "date": [2023, 5, 20],
    "info": "I enjoyed making this piece. There are quite a few things I would've changed, but overall I enjoyed how it turned out. It was a more abstract piece with less actual rendering and more stylistic coloring, using shades that don't typically appear."

  "Jelly": {
    "name": "Jelly",
    "date": [2023, 5, 30],
    "info": "This is one of my favorite pieces, despite being made a while ago. I enjoyed the color palette, and the semi-transparent jellyfish was nearly perfect. The backlight was also very nice. The only issue I had was with the clothing and pose."

    "name": "Angel",
    "date": [2023, 7, 21],
    "info": "The second angel piece I have here! Was pretty detailed, but the metal was shabby in my opinion. After this, I decided I wanted to adopt a more paint-like style, instead of this smoothened out style."

    "name": "Pirate",
    "date": [2023, 8, 18],
    "info": "This was originally created as a redraw of the Sailor piece. I'd like to think it turned out better. It's colors are more extreme, but again, I seemed to have forgotten how to draw metal again."

  "Demon(2)": {
    "name": "Demon",
    "date": [2023, 12, 17],
    "info": "This was drawn after a long long break (2 months) where I was extremely busy. I think it turned out surprisingly well given I basically drew nothing digitally during this time period. The metal armor turned out nice."

    "date": [2023, 12, 31],
    "info": "A very rushed piece as I was running out of time. Drew this on the Carnival cruise ship to Mexico during winter break. Personally, I think it turned out suboptimal, but it is a piece nonetheless."

  "Discord": {
    "name": "Discord",
    "date": [2024, 1, 7],

  "Justice": {
    "name": "Justice",
    "date": [2024, 2, 3],
    "info": "Another hated piece. It looked much better in my head, but on the tablet it looks terrible, personally. This was my last piece before another long break as I got busy again."

    "date": [2024, 4, 27],

  "Be_Your_Army": {
    "name": "Be Your Army",
    "date": [2024, 5, 18],
    "info": "Started out as a cool sketch that I turned digital. The helmet turned out nice, but the face and body was rushed. The overall theme and background was cool though. It took me a while to get that oil-spill effect."

    "name": "Blob King",
    "date": [2024, 6, 13],
    "info": "My profile picture! I had a few cool reference photos for this piece and the semi-transparent jelly feel turned out really nice. The foreground and background were rushed though."

    "date": [2024, 8, 6],

    "date": [2024, 10, 7],
    "info": "Wanted to expand more on the line art and sketch focus of the previous piece. So, this piece is much more sketching and dirty. The shapes didn't turn out as clearly as I had hoped. The metal, ghost, and candles turned out nicely though."
